Lorenzo advice:
“Personally, I usually start with the database layout so that the database is modelling the information the way I want. Then I go ahead and add the backend, the Flask code, the Python code, and then I move on to the frontend where I then receive feedback on the frontend where I use the feedback to make it more stylish and elegant and presentable with everything else already in place. This is just me though, it varies from developer to developer.”
